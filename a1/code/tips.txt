1:
Weighted A star doesnt improve with time because the bias will shift. Initially,
the weight is set at a certain number and decrement when pruning, but with more
time, eventually the weight will become 1 and lose its effect. Therefore, there
is no significant improvement.



2:
The min_move_heuristic falls short when there are obstacle lies between the
goal car and the exit. However, the min_move_heuristic still be consider admissible
because the h(n) is always less than or equal to the h^*(n).


3:
The improve version of heuristic from min_move is better because now it takes
into the account of the obstacle where adding an extra cost to get through the
obstacle lies between the goal car and exit. The alternative still consider as
admissible heuristic because its h(n) is also less than or equal to the h^*(n).
Also, comparing the min_move to the alternative, even though both are admissible,
the alternative heuristic function gives more insight than the min_move.
